				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>Zhe Hou obtained PhD from the Australian National University. He has developed various automated reasoning techniques and tools for separation logic -- a logic for reasoning about computer programs with pointers and other mutable data structures. In 2015 he joined Nanyang Technological University to undertake the project "Securify", in which he developed formal models of the SPARCv8 instruction set architecture and TSO weak memory model, and verified information-flow security for the formal models. He joined Griffith University in 2017 on a project to develop trusted autonomous systems and advanced model checking techniques in collaboration with Australia Defense Science and Technology Group. He became a lecturer at Griffith University in late 2019. </p>
				
				<h2>Research Interests</h2>

				<p>Automated reasoning: separation logic, theorem proving, model checking.<br/>
				Formal methods: program verification, weak memory model, information-flow security.<br/>
				Autonomous systems: planning, goal reasoning.<br/>
				Machine learning: prediction, large scale data analytics.<br/>

				<h2>Spare Time</h2>
				
				<p>Zhe has a garage project in which he and his friends integrate the state-of-the-art automated reasoning techniques into an efficient machine learning tool called <a href="https://www.depintel.com/silas/">Silas</a> in order to achieve explainable and verifiable machine learning. The result is a Silas extension that is able to extract the core decision-making of machine learning models and formally verify that the machine learning models are correct with respect to certain user-specified criteria.</p>
