				<h2>Short Bio</h2>

				<!-- <p>Zhe Hou (common: "Zee Ho", correct-ish: "Hojer") obtained his PhD from the Australian National University. He has developed various automated reasoning techniques and tools for separation logic -- a logic for reasoning about computer programs with pointers and other mutable data structures. In 2015 he joined Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, to undertake the project "Securify", in which he developed formal models of the SPARCv8 instruction set architecture and TSO weak memory model, and verified information-flow security for the formal models. He joined Griffith University, Australia, in 2017 on a project to develop trusted autonomous systems and advanced model checking techniques in collaboration with Australia Defense Science and Technology. He became a lecturer at Griffith University in late 2019. </p> -->

					Zhe Hou 
					<!-- was born in Xi'an, one of the most historical cities in the world and a cultural centre of China since 1000 BC. Zhe  -->
					obtained his PhD from the Australian National University, Canberra, and was a student of <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rpg/">Rajeev Gore</a> and <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~tiu/">Alwen Tiu</a>. His PhD topic was automated reasoning for separation logic --- a logic for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs with pointers and other mutable data structures. In 2015, he joined Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and worked under <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/">Yang Liu</a> and Alwen Tiu as a postdoc on formal verification of information flow security for instruction set architecture and weak memory models.  Planned to settle down in Melbourne, but after a call from <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/">Jin Song Dong</a>, he joined Griffith University in 2017 on a project to develop trusted autonomous systems and advanced model checking techniques in collaboration with Australia Defense Science and Technology. He became a faculty member at Griffith in late 2019.

				<h2>Spare Time</h2>
				
				<!-- <p>Zhe has a garage project in which he and his friends integrate the state-of-the-art automated reasoning techniques into an efficient machine learning tool called <a href="https://www.depintel.com/silas/">Silas</a> in order to achieve explainable and verifiable machine learning. The result is a Silas extension that is able to extract the core decision-making of machine learning models and formally verify that the machine learning models are correct with respect to certain user-specified criteria.</p> -->

				<p>Zhe is also a sketch artist, and he takes custom orders for a price of AU$ 500K and above. See some samples <a href="/arts/">here</a>. </p>
