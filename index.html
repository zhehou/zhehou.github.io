        		<!-- <p>Zhe Hou is currently a research fellow at Griffith University. He is working on integrating automated reasoning techniques into machine learning, planning and goal reasoning, which will be applied to trusted autonomous systems.</p> -->

				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>Zhe Hou obtained PhD from The Australian National University. He has developed various automated reasoning techniques and tools for separation logic -- a logic for reasoning about programs with pointers and other mutable data structures. In 2015 He joined Nanyang Technological University to undertake the project "Securify", which is about verifying the correctness and security of computer systems. He was the main researcher responsible for developing formal models of the SPARCv8 instruction set architecture and weak memory model, and verifying information-flow security. He joined Griffith University in 2017 on a project to develop trusted autonomous systems in collaboration with Australia Defense Science and Technology Group.</p>
				
				<h2>Research Interests</h2>

				<p>Automated reasoning: separation logic, theorem proving, model checking.<br/>
				Formal methods: program verification, weak memory model, information-flow security.<br/>
				Autonomous systems: planning, goal reasoning.<br/>
				AI: reinforcement learning.<br/>
